# Security Policy

## Supported versions

gofluent is pre-1.0. Security fixes are applied to the most recent release and
to `main`. Until 1.0, only the latest release line is supported.

| Version       | Supported          |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Latest `0.x`  | :white_check_mark: |
| Older         | :x:                |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately. **Do not open a public issue
for a security problem.**

- Preferred: open a private report through GitHub Security Advisories — the
  **Report a vulnerability** button under the repository's **Security** tab.
- Alternatively, email <headcrabogon@gmail.com> with a description and, where
  possible, a minimal reproduction.

You can expect an acknowledgement within a few business days. Once a fix is
ready we will coordinate disclosure and credit reporters who wish to be named.

## Threat model

gofluent is a localization library. The classes of issue we consider in scope:

- Inputs that cause excessive CPU or memory use. The resolver bounds placeable
  expansion with `MaxPlaceables` to mitigate Billion-Laughs / quadratic-blowup
  style attacks.
- Panics on input. With an error sink supplied, the resolver is designed to be
  fault-tolerant and must not panic; a reproducible panic is a bug we want to
  hear about.

Translations and FTL resources are treated as **trusted input** authored by the
application. Rendering FTL supplied by untrusted third parties is outside the
intended threat model.
